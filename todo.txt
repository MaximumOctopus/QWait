in progress:

- New visitor types. the current options seem very unrealistic. the next update will have a complete rewrite, including groups, families, singles 

- visitor spending information. how much they pay etc.

- more park types (hopefully using real-world data) (ongoing research)




- travelling/waiting when accessing new fastpass ticket

- more visitor autonomy - less rigid mechanisms of ride selection and park navigation

- ensure Ride::WaitTime() is accurate in both modes

- ensure fastpass tickets are given out to visitors so that they don't overlap or prevent from being used due to times

- tool to visually display visitor positions

- tweak visitor logic

- better opening and closing park and ride logic

- simulate at a higher resolution (is a minute too long?!)
